Bank-Notes-Dispenser-and-Calculator
===================================

This program calculates the change required by a user, after a transaction according to the denominations available

This program calculates the change required by a buyer, after a purchase according to the denominations available

This program assumes that a seller has only denominations of 100, 50, 20, 10, 5 and 1.

A class “MakeChange” was then created that takes an integer amount representing the total

change to make and return an integer representing the smallest possible number of bills to return.

For example a call of MakeChange(135) would result in a return value of 4 (1 one hundred bill, 1 twenty bill, 1 ten bill and 1 five bill).

Feel free to test it with as many change needed as possible.
